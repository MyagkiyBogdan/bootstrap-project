Attention! 
The project was created to practice the skills of using bootstrap components and using the grid methodology. The gallery page is written WITHOUT using bootstrap, built on grid and fully adapted.
This project is written without a layout.
In this project the author specifically uses fontello icons, bootstrap adaptive grid and tags, as well as png images instead of svg sprite, @media and full-fledged Sass project.
This is for a better understanding of exactly how legacy projects were written.
Thank you for your attention!
